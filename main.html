            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Bristol, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate and driven, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence and quantitative development.</p>
            <p>I am especially interested in applying my skills to solve complex challenges in production-ready environments. Feel free to check out my GitHub to see some of the projects I’ve worked on so far!</p>
            <p>Please contact me on LinkedIn if you have any further questions or queries.</p>

                <h2>Stochastic Pair Trading Bot</h2>
                <p>This project implements a stochastic AI-driven pair trading bot focused on the stocks AMAT (Applied Materials) and NXPI (NXP Semiconductors), selected based on cointegration analysis. The bot leverages two AI layers: a Gradient Boosting model and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities between the two securities, complete with a backtesting and live performance framework. I am working to futher improve this project at the moment.</p>

                <p>A simple machine learning project that uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to recognize handwritten digits (0–9). It includes a Python-based drawing interface and C++ for the core machine learning logic. The C++ logic was programed entirely from scratch by myself (training and prediction framework), and then trained from data I pulled from the MNIST dataset.</p>
